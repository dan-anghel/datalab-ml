    "This notebook continues the codifies the capabilities discussed in this [blog post](https://8081-dot-3124631-dot-devshell.appspot.com/). In a nutshell, it uses the pre-trained inception model as a starting point and then uses transfer learning to train it further on additional, customer-specific images. For explanation, simple flower images are used. Compared to training from scratch, the time and costs are drastically reduced.\n",

    "This notebook does preprocessing, training and prediction by calling CloudML API instead of running them in the Datalab container.  The purpose of local work is to do some initial prototyping and debugging on small scale data - often by taking a suitable (say 0.1 - 1%) sample of the full data. The same basic steps can then be repeated with much larger datasets in cloud."
